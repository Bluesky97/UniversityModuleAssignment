# UniversityModuleAssignment
This is my first program with Java Programming to create a University Module Registration System. This is done by myself not group project. I started learning programming since Diploma in PSB Academy (2015-2016) and I need to do this project by using Netbeans - Console Application. Also, this project is not linked with any databases.

To run this project:
(Netbeans IDE) is required to install on your computer.
Link is provided below here: https://netbeans.org/downloads/index.html

Step 1: Open NetBeans
Step 2: Go to File -> Open Project -> Choose Project (DICT415IPA1 - Andrian Alexander Putra)
Step 3: Run the project from the DICT415IPA.java

========================
BUILD OUTPUT DESCRIPTION
========================

When you build an Java application project that has a main class, the IDE
automatically copies all of the JAR files on the projects classpath to your projects dist/lib folder. 
The IDE also adds each of the JAR files to the Class-Path element in the application JAR files manifest file (MANIFEST.MF).

To run the project from the command line, go to the dist folder and
type the following:

java -jar "DICT415IPA1.jar" 

To distribute this project, zip up the dist folder (including the lib folder)
and distribute the ZIP file.

Notes:

* If two JAR files on the project classpath have the same name, only the first
JAR file is copied to the lib folder.
* Only JAR files are copied to the lib folder.
If the classpath contains other types of files or folders, these files (folders)
are not copied.
* If a library on the projects classpath also has a Class-Path element
specified in the manifest,the content of the Class-Path element has to be on
the projects runtime path.
* To set a main class in a standard Java project, right-click the project node
in the Projects window and choose Properties. Then click Run and enter the
class name in the Main Class field. Alternatively, you can manually type the
class name in the manifest Main-Class element.
